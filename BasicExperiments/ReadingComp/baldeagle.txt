The Bald Eagle is a majestic bird. The adult bird has a brown body, brown wings, white head, and large, hooked yellow bill. Younger birds appear all brown. Bald Eagles almost always live near water because their main food source is fish. Sometimes, however, Bald Eagles will eat dead animals (carrion). They will even steal food from other birds such as ospreys and gulls! It was for this reason that the famous Patriot Benjamin Franklin preferred the Wild Turkey as America's National symbol. Nevertheless, the Bald Eagle remains America's symbol.
