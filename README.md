# PsychoPyParadigms

Experimental paradigms run with PsychoPy that Iâ€™ve accumulated over the past year, including EyeLink and SMI eye tracker interfaces. 

SampleExperiment represents my current estimate of best practices in logging and timing.

GeneralTools and EyeTrackerTools should be added to PsychoPy's path in Preferences --> General --> paths.
